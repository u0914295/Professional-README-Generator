# Professional-README-Generator

## Description

My motivation for building this application was to create an easier way to make a professional README file for future projects powered through node.js. I built this project because writing a README file can be an involved process that takes more time than I'd like. With this application, the README file is automatically formatted. This solves any errors you may experience when trying to properly format your README file for a project or application you're working on. Through coding this application, I learned that node.js is a powerful tool that allows the user to create non-blocking, event-driven servers as well as websites and back-end API services.

## Installation 

To install this application, download the respository and open it VSCode. From there, open the terminal within VSCode and navigate to the specified folder. Then, run the command "node index.js". The application will then commence, prompting you to enter the information needed for a professional README file.

## Usage

Once you have ran the "node index.js" command within the specified folder within VSCode, the application will prompt you to answer questions that are required when writing a professional README file. Press the "Enter" key after each question asked. Once complete, the README file will generate within the folder you opened with VSCode. Save the file, then navigate to the folder that you downloaded from this repository. The README file should be within. Copy/paste the README file wherever needed to easily upload to your GitHub project repository. You can also preview the README file as it would appear on your GitHub repository by right-clicking on the generated README file and clicking "Open With..." then "Markdown Preview" after finishing the prompted questions in VSCode. A screenshot showing this preview is as follows:
